# Controllable

This is a fork of MrCrayfish's [Controllable](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/Controllable) mod, but updated to make controller stick dead zones work much better.

I created this fork because the original mod didn't work well with mods like MrCrayfish's [Vehicle Mod](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/MrCrayfishVehicleMod), as the joysticks (which are used to turn your vehicle) didn't respect the dead zone setting on the controller, leading to vehicles turning on their own.
